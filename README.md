# Bin2Dec_converter
A simple java file capable of converting binary input of any size to a double output.

## Human Friendly
This version is capable of taking input using Scanner, so you are prompted to a "dialog" with the script. Not very useful, but is a good example of how to use the Scanner module

## Machine Friendly
This version is capable of reading input directly from the command line, you can use it as part of a project if you want. After creating the ".jar" file, you run it on the command line using:
```
java -jar bit_dec_converter.jar 11111111
```
